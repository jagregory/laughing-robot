    The <b>Semantic Web</b> is a collaborative movement led by the international standards body, the World Wide Web
    Consortium (W3C).[1] The standard promotes common data formats on the World Wide Web. By encouraging the inclusion
    of semantic content in web pages, the Semantic Web aims at converting the current web dominated by unstructured and
    semi-structured documents into a "web of data". The Semantic Web stack builds on the W3C's Resource Description
    Framework (RDF).[2]
    <br /><br />
    According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across
    application, enterprise, and community boundaries."[2]
    <br /><br />
    The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee,[3] the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web
    Consortium ("W3C"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web
    as "a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines."
    <br /><br />
    While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human
    sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept. Scholars have explored the social
    potential of the semantic web in the business and health sectors, and for social networking.[4]
    <br /><br />
    The original 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution
    of the existing Web to a Semantic Web,[5] but this has yet to happen. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated
    that: "This simple idea ... remains largely unrealized."[6]
    <br /><br />

    <b>History</b>
    <br /><br />
    The concept of the Semantic Network Model was formed in the early sixties by the cognitive scientist Allan M.
    Collins, linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus in various publications,[7][8][9][10][11] as
    a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. It extends the network of hyperlinked human-readable web
    pages by inserting machine-readable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other, enabling automated
    agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users. The term was coined by Tim
    Berners-Lee,[3] the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C"), which
    oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as "a web of data that can
    be processed directly and indirectly by machines."
    <br /><br />
    Many of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella.
    These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and
    defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among
    businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as microformats.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Purpose</b>
    <br /><br />
    The main purpose of the Semantic Web is driving the evolution of the current Web by enabling users to find, share,
    and combine information more easily. Humans are capable of using the Web to carry out tasks such as finding the
    Estonian translation for "twelve months", reserving a library book, and searching for the lowest price for a DVD.
    However, machines cannot accomplish all of these tasks without human direction, because web pages are designed to be
    read by people, not machines. The semantic web is a vision of information that can be readily interpreted by
    machines, so machines can perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, combining, and acting upon
    information on the web.
    <br /><br />
    The Semantic Web, as originally envisioned, is a system that enables machines to "understand" and respond to complex
    human requests based on their meaning. Such an "understanding" requires that the relevant information sources be
    semantically structured.
    <br /><br />
    Tim Berners-Lee originally expressed the vision of the Semantic Web as follows:[12]
    <br /><br />
    I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web â€“ the content,
    links, and transactions between people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which should make this possible, has yet to
    emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by
    machines talking to machines. The "intelligent agents" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.
    <br /><br />
    The Semantic Web is regarded as an integrator across different content, information applications and systems. It has
    applications in publishing, blogging, and many other areas.
    <br /><br />
    Often the terms "semantics", "metadata", "ontologies" and "Semantic Web" are used inconsistently. In particular,
    these terms are used as everyday terminology by researchers and practitioners, spanning a vast landscape of
    different fields, technologies, concepts and application areas. Furthermore, there is confusion with regard to the
    current status of the enabling technologies envisioned to realize the Semantic Web. In a paper presented by Gerber,
    Barnard and Van der Merwe[14] the Semantic Web landscape is charted and a brief summary of related terms and
    enabling technologies is presented. The architectural model proposed by Tim Berners-Lee is used as basis to present
    a status model that reflects current and emerging technologies.[15]
